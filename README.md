# 2017_patent_grants_analytics

A data analytics case study using USPTO bulk data from patents granted in 2017

Raw data used in the analysis is available here: https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/patent/grant/redbook/bibliographic/2017/


There are two jupyter notebooks included in the repository:
(1) data_wrangling_and_cleaning
(2) data_storytelling

The `/scripts` folder contains any algorithms not implemented in a jupyter
notebook.

For please feel free to comment and provide feedback.  I will continue to update
the repository as I continue developing this project.
